some tips:
* You should set input and output bin file address on running jar file of project (as argument arg[0] , arg[1]) .
* You should set error log file address in log4j.properties
* I have no time for implementing TRIVIAL implementation og encoding but I take a photo from my algorithm and put it into repository files named trivial_encode_algorithm.jpg .
